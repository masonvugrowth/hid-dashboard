"""MCP tool wrappers — thin shims over chat_tools.execute_tool().

chat_tools is the single source of truth for what data Claude can read.
The in-app HiD Assistant uses it; this MCP module reuses it so any tool
improvement automatically applies to both surfaces. Each `@mcp.tool()`
function:
  1. validates auth via ContextVar (set by McpAuthMiddleware)
  2. forwards to chat_tools.execute_tool() with the inputs
  3. writes one mcp_audit_log row (ok / error)

v1 access model: every active HiD user gets full access (all tools, all
branches). Per-user scoping can be added later by reading allowlist columns
off the User row and filtering response rows here."""
