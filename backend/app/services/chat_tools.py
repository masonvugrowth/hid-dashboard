"""
Chat tools — tool definitions exposed to Claude for the HiD assistant.

Each tool wraps existing business logic (services + raw SQL) and returns a
slim JSON payload Claude can reason over. Claude decides which tools to call
based on the user's question.

Phase 1: read-only. No mutation tools. Phase 2 will add execute-action tools
gated behind an explicit permission model.
